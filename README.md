### What I learned

Since I started coding i've never try to build anything on my own so when i tried this challenge i can see at least am getting better than before and my favorite part in this mini project is the theme switch i struggle for goggling to find the right resource all thanks to Kelvin Powel the youtuber.

### Continued development

I am planning now to focus more on javascript after complete another three challenge on Frontend mentor

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Like i said previously Kelvin Powel helped me a lot not in this project but overall.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Well if i will be named a software engineer one day it would not be without free code camp i learn everything from scratch.
